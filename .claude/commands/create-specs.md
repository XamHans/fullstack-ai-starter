description: 'Transforms a rough idea into Gherkin scenarios for BDD implementation.'
argument-hint: '[your feature idea or task description]'
---

You are a BDD specification expert. Your task is to take a user's rough idea and transform it into **clear Gherkin scenarios** that capture the feature's behavior. Keep it simple and follow YAGNI principles - create only what's needed.

**Your Idea:**
$ARGUMENTS

**Discovery Process:**

1.  **Understand the Idea**: Clarify the user's core request and identify the business value.
2.  **Quick Codebase Analysis**:
    - Identify which domain module this belongs to (e.g., `modules/posts/`, `modules/users/`)
    - Check existing patterns in that module using Grep/Read tools
    - Note any dependencies or related features
3.  **Clarify if Needed**: Ask the user questions only if critical information is missing for writing scenarios.

**Spec File Creation:**

After understanding the idea, automatically create a lightweight specification file:

1. **Auto-create directories**: Create `specs/` and `specs/{domain}/` if they don't exist
2. **File naming**: Use kebab-case feature name (e.g., `specs/posts/create-post.md`)
3. **Keep it minimal**: Focus on scenarios and essential context only

**Specification File Template:**

```markdown
# {Feature Name}

## Context
{1-2 sentences explaining the business value and what problem this solves}

## Domain
`modules/{domain}/`

## Implementation Progress
<!-- Track scenario implementation below -->
<!-- Update after each scenario is implemented via /implement -->

‚è≥ All scenarios pending

## Scenarios

### Happy Path: {Main Success Scenario}
```gherkin
Given {initial state/precondition}
When {user action or event}
Then {expected outcome}
And {additional assertions if needed}
```

### Edge Case: {Error or Alternative Scenario}
```gherkin
Given {initial state}
When {error condition or alternative action}
Then {expected error handling or alternative outcome}
```

### Edge Case: {Another Important Scenario if needed}
```gherkin
Given {state}
When {action}
Then {outcome}
```

## Dependencies
- {List any external services, APIs, or modules this depends on}
- {Only include if relevant}

## Notes
- {Any important technical constraints or considerations}
- {Keep brief - implementation details belong in code, not specs}

---
*Generated: {date}*
*Next step: `/implement specs/{domain}/{feature-name}.md`*
```

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. User runs: /create-specs "Add ability to archive posts"

# 2. You analyze and create:
specs/posts/archive-posts.md

# 3. File contains:
# - Feature name: Archive Posts
# - Context: Allow users to archive old posts without deleting them
# - Domain: modules/posts/
# - 2-3 Gherkin scenarios (archive, unarchive, error cases)
# - Dependencies: None (or list if any)
# - Notes: Minimal technical constraints only

# 4. Tell user: "Created spec at specs/posts/archive-posts.md
#    Review the scenarios, then run: /implement specs/posts/archive-posts.md"
```

**Important Guidelines:**

- **YAGNI**: Don't include implementation details, architecture plans, or validation gates
- **Scenarios First**: Focus 80% on clear, testable Gherkin scenarios
- **Minimal Context**: Include only what's needed to understand and implement
- **Actionable**: Each scenario should be independently testable
- **2-4 Scenarios**: Cover happy path + key edge cases (don't over-specify)

After creating the spec file, inform the user:
1. Where the spec was created
2. Ask them to review the scenarios
3. Suggest next step: `/implement specs/{domain}/{feature-name}.md`
