## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, domain-driven architecture:

- **Modular Structure**: Business logic organized by domain (users, posts, etc.)
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulated business logic with dependency injection
- **API Layer**: Standardized REST endpoints with authentication and error handling
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and BDD testing with comprehensive coverage
